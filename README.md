# Questionnaire API

Our API is a question bank framework in which clients can create, update and delete their own questions (title, four choices and answers) as well as rank their end-users and get data analytics. Our swagger link: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/VV2317/questionnaire-api/1.0.0#/. 

Our API uses H2 database to store question banks for each client. Every client's information is stored separately and cannot be accessed from another client. To use our API, the user needs to first boot up our Spring server by running `./mvnw spring-boot:run`. The user can then use curl commands to create, update or delete questions. Testing can be done by accessing our [Postman API](https://warped-comet-420882.postman.co/workspace/Questionnaire-API-Testing~8fba67a5-16c4-42c2-831b-9b0c3f9e6050/overview). To access our database, go to web broswer and enter `localhost:8080/h2-console`.

## Authentication and Authorization
A bearer token is needed in order to make CRUD commands to our API. Otherwise, 401 unauthorized errors will be received.

To retrieve a bearer token, use the following curl command.

```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://dev-lb0aibabfhuc6e6j.us.auth0.com/oauth/token \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"client_id":"LsVAxRmvrm8yxktqXOzdDWWn6mlAxd6P","client_secret":"DJeBImCv2Mi6Qbe3_m2mYPwAHSkuJO_YoXm_XlnWRg1B0myVdS4BPhO1BeaeCa3I","audience":"localhost:8080","grant_type":"client_credentials"}'
```

Use the bearer token provided in the response body and pass this in the request header when making CRUD commands.

Here is an example of what the curl command would look like:
```
curl --request GET \
  --url http://path_to_your_api/ \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer {BEARER_TOKEN}'
```

## Continuous Integration
CI is accessible in the 'Actions' tab on our GitHub repo: https://github.com/ad3707/advancedSWE/actions

## How to Run Our Project

1. **Clone:** run `git clone https://github.com/ad3707/advancedSWE.git` in your terminal
2. **Install JDK 17:** Run `javac -version` in your terminal and confirm it returns `javac 17.*.*`. If the version is older, you can [use this link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17) to download and install the package compatible with your local machine.
3. **Install dependencies:** `./mvnw install`
4. **Run tests:** `./mvnw test`
5. **Run Clean (run before running test if error comes up):** `./mvnw clean`

## How to Test Our Project on Postman

### Our Client
Our client is a classroom platform that allows teachers to create exams for their students. They can add questions, delete questions, update questions, add students to their class, delete students, update students, and retrieve the top students in their class by using our API service. An example of some third party using our server for their own client is a company that hosts multiple trivia games such as geography, math, and history trivia where each category is their own client. 

**To run the client:**
1. Download this repo: https://github.com/ad3707/advancedSWEClient/tree/main
2. After downloading the repo, unzip it and open up the folder in VSCode.
3. Go to the index.html file under views and in the bottom right click Go Live.
4. If you do not see the "Go Live" button, then install this: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
5. Run the API service in another terminal. 
6. While the API service is running, the client is able to use the functionalities of our API.

### Checkstyle Reports:

We are using Checkstyle's sun_checks ruleset. Although our code is not fully compliant with the rules it defines as of right now, you can see present errors by going into the folder styleReports --> site --> checkstyle.html. To see the up-to-date checkstyle report, run ./mvnw site. A new folder called "target" should appear in your workspace folder. Go to target --> site --> checkstyle.html. Right click on checkstyle.html and "reveal in finder". Then click on the checkstyle.html from finder and it should launch a web page with the error report.

Our API uses the following external code in our codebase:  
[CrudRepository](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/CrudRepository.html). Our UserRepository and QuestionReposity extend this interface which supports storing and updating information of our users and questions with corresponding CRUD actions. 
[Java Persistence](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/package-summary.html) which manages object and relational mapping for our User and Question.  
[Springframework.web.bind.annotation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/package-summary.html) which binds requests to controllers and handler methods and binds request parameters to method arguments.  
[MockBean](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/test/mock/mockito/MockBean.html) and [Mockito](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/test/mock/mockito/package-summary.html) which mock objects for unit testing.
