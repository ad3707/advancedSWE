# Questionnaire API

Our API is a question bank framework in which clients can create, update and delete their own questions (title, four choices and answers) as well as rank their end-users and get data analytics. Our swagger link: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/VV2317/questionnaire-api/1.0.0#/. 

Our API uses H2 database to store question banks for each client. Every client's information is stored separately and cannot be accessed from another client. To use our API, the user needs to first boot up our Spring server by running `./mvnw spring-boot:run`. The user can then use curl commands to create, update or delete questions. Testing can be done by accessing our [Postman API](https://warped-comet-420882.postman.co/workspace/Questionnaire-API-Testing~8fba67a5-16c4-42c2-831b-9b0c3f9e6050/overview). To access our database, go to web broswer and enter `localhost:8080/h2-console`.

## Authentication and Authorization
A bearer token is needed in order to make CRUD commands to our API. Otherwise, 401 unauthorized errors will be received.

To retrieve a bearer token, use the following curl command.

```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://dev-lb0aibabfhuc6e6j.us.auth0.com/oauth/token \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"client_id":"LsVAxRmvrm8yxktqXOzdDWWn6mlAxd6P","client_secret":"DJeBImCv2Mi6Qbe3_m2mYPwAHSkuJO_YoXm_XlnWRg1B0myVdS4BPhO1BeaeCa3I","audience":"localhost:8080","grant_type":"client_credentials"}'
```

Use the bearer token provided in the response body and pass this in the request header when making CRUD commands.

Here is an example of what the curl command would look like:
```
curl --request GET \
  --url http://path_to_your_api/ \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer {BEARER_TOKEN}'
```

## SonarCloud

We have integrated static analysis with GitHub Workflows. Click the checkmark/'x' next to the most recent commit. Then click 'Details' for 'SonarCloud Code Analysis'. Scroll to bottom of page and click 'View more details on SonarCloud'.

This will give you information about the code coverage, code smells, bugs, and vulnerabilities.

## SonarQube

**Currently working with SonarCube locally**

**Pull most recent version of GitHub repository code:** we have put sonarcube in gitignore because it is a really big file. You only need to download it once for now

Download SonarQube:
1. Download and install Java 11 on your system.
2. Download the SonarQube Community Edition zip file (located [here](https://www.sonarqube.org/success-download-community-edition/)).
3. Unzip the downloaded file and rename the folder ‘sonarqube’
4. Move this file inside your ‘advancedSWE’ folder (unable to push it to GitHub for some reason so need to do it this way)

**To start Sonarcube server (run in terminal from advancedSWE folder; will take some time to load):**
`./sonarqube/bin/macosx-universal-64/sonar.sh console`

**Go to home page:** http://localhost:9000/
	Username: admin
	Password: admin

You can change the password to whatever you like since this will be local to your computer.

**Create a new project; follow the steps**
1. On the page with header 'How do you want to create your project?', select `Manually`.   
2. You will then be directed to a 'Create new project' page. Enter a project name of your choice with at least one non-digit. The project key will match 3. your project name. Click `set up` after you see green checkmarks on both input boxes.  
4. You will then be directed to your app's 'Overview'. On that page, click `Locally`.  
5. On the next page, you will be provided with a default token name. Click `Generate`, and then click `Continue`.  
6. Select `maven` and copy the code block. Replace the first line with: `./mvnw test sonar:sonar \`
7. Open another terminal (can do directly from VSCode terminal) and configure maven wrapper by running `./mvnw clean install`
8. Run Sonarcube. It should look something like this (but will vary when you do it with your account):
```
./mvnw test sonar:sonar \
  -Dsonar.projectKey=your-project-name \
  -Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000 \
  -Dsonar.login=sqp_c5c3a7e22937ee7d5eb02e7698fc99d383c859a1
```

Uses target folder to get unit test coverage report. Use “verify” instead of “test” for integration tests.

**See coverage results on localhost:** http://localhost:9000/dashboard?id=your-project-name, go to 'Overall Code' section and you should see a graph-based report of test coverage. Other information you can find:  
- Bugs
- Vulnerabilities
- Security hotspots
- Technical debt (how much time it will take to fix errors)
- Code smells
- Code coverage

**See coverage results in project folder:** After running sonarqube, you can find an `index.html` file generated under `/target/site`. Once loaded in your browser, you should see something like this (currently we're at 88% coverage):

## How to Run Our Project

1. **Clone:** run `git clone https://github.com/ad3707/advancedSWE.git` in your terminal
2. **Install JDK 17:** Run `javac -version` in your terminal and confirm it returns `javac 17.*.*`. If the version is older, you can [use this link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17) to download and install the package compatible with your local machine.
3. **Install dependencies:** `./mvnw install`
4. **Run tests:** `./mvnw test`
5. **Run Clean (run before running test if error comes up):** `./mvnw clean`

## How to Test Our Project on Postman

1. Run Spring-Boot from terminal: `./mvnw spring-boot:run`
2. While it is running, go to Postman: https://warped-comet-420882.postman.co/workspace/Questionnaire-API-Testing~8fba67a5-16c4-42c2-831b-9b0c3f9e6050/collection/23969942-f4487392-6f96-4cf2-b49b-f86418ef93b8?ctx=documentation

### Our Client
Our client is a classroom platform that allows teachers to create exams for their students. They can add questions, delete questions, update questions, add students to their class, delete students, update students, and retrieve the top students in their class by using our API service. An example of some third party using our server for their own client is a company that hosts multiple trivia games such as geography, math, and history trivia where each category is their own client.

### Checkstyle Reports:

We are using Checkstyle's sun_checks ruleset. Although our code is not fully compliant with the rules it defines as of right now, you can see present errors by going into the folder styleReports --> site --> checkstyle.html. To see the up-to-date checkstyle report, run ./mvnw site. A new folder called "target" should appear in your workspace folder. Go to target --> site --> checkstyle.html. Right click on checkstyle.html and "reveal in finder". Then click on the checkstyle.html from finder and it should launch a web page with the error report.

Our API uses the following external code in our codebase:  
[CrudRepository](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/CrudRepository.html). Our UserRepository and QuestionReposity extend this interface which supports storing and updating information of our users and questions with corresponding CRUD actions. 
[Java Persistence](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/package-summary.html) which manages object and relational mapping for our User and Question.  
[Springframework.web.bind.annotation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/package-summary.html) which binds requests to controllers and handler methods and binds request parameters to method arguments.  
[MockBean](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/test/mock/mockito/MockBean.html) and [Mockito](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/test/mock/mockito/package-summary.html) which mock objects for unit testing.
