# Questionnaire API

Our API is a question bank framework in which clients can create, update and delete their own questions (title, four choices and answers) as well as rank their end-users and get data analytics. Our swagger link: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/VV2317/questionnaire-api/1.0.0#/. 

Our API uses H2 database to store question banks for each client. Every client's information is stored separately and cannot be accessed from another client. To use our API, the user needs to first boot up our Spring server by running `./mvnw spring-boot:run`. The user can then use curl commands to create, update or delete questions. Testing can be done by accessing our [Postman API](https://warped-comet-420882.postman.co/workspace/Questionnaire-API-Testing~8fba67a5-16c4-42c2-831b-9b0c3f9e6050/overview). To access our database, go to web broswer and enter `localhost:8080/h2-console`.

**Checkstyle Reports**:

We are using Checkstyle's sun_checks ruleset. Although our code is not fully compliant with the rules it defines as of right now, you can see present errors by going into the folder styleReports --> site --> checkstyle.html.

Our API uses the following external code in our codebase:  
[CrudRepository](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/CrudRepository.html). Our UserRepository and QuestionReposity extend this interface which supports storing and updating information of our users and questions with corresponding CRUD actions. 
[Java Persistence](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/package-summary.html) which manages object and relational mapping for our User and Question.  
[Springframework.web.bind.annotation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/package-summary.html) which binds requests to controllers and handler methods and binds request parameters to method arguments.  
[MockBean](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/test/mock/mockito/MockBean.html) and [Mockito](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/test/mock/mockito/package-summary.html) which mock objects for unit testing.
