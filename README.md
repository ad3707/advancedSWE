# Questionnaire API

Our API is a question bank framework in which clients can create, update and delete their own questions (title, four choices and answers) as well as rank their end-users and get data analytics. Our swagger link: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/VV2317/questionnaire-api/1.0.0#/. 

Our API uses H2 database to store question banks for each client. Every client's information is stored separately and cannot be accessed from another client. To use our API, the user needs to first boot up our Spring server by running `./mvnw spring-boot:run`. The user can then use curl commands to create, update or delete questions. Testing can be done by accessing our [Postman API](https://warped-comet-420882.postman.co/workspace/Questionnaire-API-Testing~8fba67a5-16c4-42c2-831b-9b0c3f9e6050/overview). To access our database, go to web broswer and enter `localhost:8080/h2-console`.

## How to Run Our Project

1. **Clone:** run `git clone https://github.com/ad3707/advancedSWE.git` in your terminal
2. **Install JDK 17:** Run `javac -version` in your terminal and confirm it returns `javac 17.*.*`. If the version is older, you can use this [link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17) to download and install the package compatible with your local machine.
3. **Install dependencies:** `./mvnw install`
4. **Run tests:** `./mvnw test`
5. **Run Clean (run before running test if error comes up):** `./mvnw clean`

## How to Test Our Project on Postman

1. Run Spring-Boot from terminal: `./mvnw spring-boot:run`
2. While it is running, go to Postman: https://warped-comet-420882.postman.co/workspace/Questionnaire-API-Testing~8fba67a5-16c4-42c2-831b-9b0c3f9e6050/collection/23969942-f4487392-6f96-4cf2-b49b-f86418ef93b8?ctx=documentation

### Leaderboards

**Get Top K Users**

**Checkstyle Reports**:

We are using Checkstyle's sun_checks ruleset. Although our code is not fully compliant with the rules it defines as of right now, you can see present errors by going into the folder styleReports --> site --> checkstyle.html. To see the up-to-date checkstyle report, run ./mvnw site. A new folder called "target" should appear in your workspace folder. Go to target --> site --> checkstyle.html. Right click on checkstyle.html and "reveal in finder". Then click on the checkstyle.html from finder and it should launch a web page with the error report.

Our API uses the following external code in our codebase:  
[CrudRepository](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/CrudRepository.html). Our UserRepository and QuestionReposity extend this interface which supports storing and updating information of our users and questions with corresponding CRUD actions. 
[Java Persistence](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/package-summary.html) which manages object and relational mapping for our User and Question.  
[Springframework.web.bind.annotation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/package-summary.html) which binds requests to controllers and handler methods and binds request parameters to method arguments.  
[MockBean](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/test/mock/mockito/MockBean.html) and [Mockito](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/test/mock/mockito/package-summary.html) which mock objects for unit testing.
